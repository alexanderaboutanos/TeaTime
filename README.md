### What is TeaTime?

- TeaTime is the nexus for all your tea adventures. Î‘fter creating your own personal account, you can keep track of your teas, browse a huge database of to discover new teas, and construct your very own wishlist!
- Tech details: On a more technical note, TeaTime is a full stack application consisting of an Express/Node.js backend and a React Frontend. API calls are made to the Express backend, with full CRUD capabilities on a PSQL database. API calls are also made to the external API, Spoonacular. The frontend was polished with React-Bootstrap.

### Getting Started

- When first entering the TeaTime application, you have two options: Signup and Login

- Login - If you already have an account, select login and enter your username and password.
- Signup - If you do not have an account... select signup button. Now, enter your details.

- "Will my password be safe?" - Yes. TeaTime will take your password and encrypt it, never exposing it to sneaky cyber attacks.

- Local Storage - Did your cat accidentaly close your browser window? It would be a nuisance to have to enter your login details again. Fear not, your account details will be stored on local storage so you only need to access the site again and you will be automatically logged in.
- Profile - If you ever want to revist your account details, simply click the profile button on the navigation bar at the top of your page.
- Data - all of your tea data will be stored on an external database and will not be lost when you refresh the page, or access the website from a friend's house. That being said, we promise not to sell your data (unless someone offers a great price).
