                  <b>Tech details:</b> On a more technical note, TeaTime is a
                  full stack application consisting of an Express/Node.js
                  backend and a React Frontend. API calls are made to the
                  Express backend, with full CRUD capabilities on a PSQL
                  database. API calls are also made to the external API,
                  Spoonacular. The frontend was polished with React-Bootstrap.
